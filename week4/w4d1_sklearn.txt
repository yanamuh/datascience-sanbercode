SKLEARN
- open source lib
- provide various tools : model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection & evaluation, etc

FITTING & PREDICTING : estimator basics
- provide built in ML algo and models (called estimator)
- fitted to data using fit()

 input fit()
1. samples matrix x. 
size of x typically (n_samples, n_features)
n_samples= rows, n_features = columns
2. target values y. (real numb for regression tasks or int for classification).
y is usually 1d array, where the i-th entry corresponds to the target of i-th sample (row) of x
